# Beekeeping
Beekeeping Embedded System
Our connected beehive project aims to monitor and improve the health of bee colonies. The general problem is the increasing disappearance of bee populations, which is a major issue for agriculture and biodiversity.

The connected beehive uses sensors to track the parameters of the hive, such as temperature, humidity, and weight, and transmit this data to an application for beekeepers to monitor colonies remotely. In case of problems, beekeepers can intervene quickly to save the colonies. This will help better understand the needs of bees and protect colonies against diseases and pests.

In short, our project aims to contribute to the preservation of bee populations by helping beekeepers better monitor and protect colonies.  


Overall project vision
Our connected beehive project uses a combination of sensors to track the parameters of the hive. To measure temperature, we use a high-precision temperature sensor that is installed both inside and outside of the hive. The sensors are connected to a microcontroller that processes the data and transmits it to a wireless communication board using Lora network (a network that allows for the Internet of things), and then the data is sent to a web application (in our case we used Ubidots and then Beep). The weight data is also transmitted via the wireless communication board.

These web platforms will allow beekeepers to view data in real-time, track trends, and receive alerts in case of problems. Beekeepers can also set thresholds for different parameters, so they are alerted when values exceed a certain level.

In summary, our connected beehive project uses a combination of sensors to track the parameters of the hive, such as temperature, humidity, weight, and autonomy of our surveillance system, and transmits the data to a web application for beekeepers to monitor colonies remotely. Beekeepers can set alerts for different parameters and use the data to take measures to protect bee colonies.
